      <h3>Early Radio in Upstate New York (1959-1963)</h3>

      <p>
        Neil’s first radio job was while he was still in high school. At age 17
        he played music on WCGR in Canandaigua, NY. Then he attended college for
        two years at Michigan State where he studied broadcasting. After
        Michigan State, Neil returned to New York in 1963 where he worked for
        WBTA 1490 in Batavia, NY.
      </p>

      <p>During this time Neil did baseball, hockey, and racing broadcasts.</p>

      <p>
        According to the Miami Herald, Neil began his talk radio career at WSPB
        1450 in Sarasota, FL.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>
          In 1973, Rogers moved to Sarasota, where quite by accident he did his
          first talk radio show. The station hired a retiree from Pittsburgh to
          do a talk show, but on his first day, the fellow couldn’t figure out
          to work the phone and his guest didn’t show up. The second day, the
          retiree’s blood pressure soared and his nose bled. Rogers, who was
          spinning records at the station, came to the rescue.
        </em>
