      <h2>Sarasota, FL (1973)</h2>
      <p>
        WSPB 1450 (Sarasota, FL) - According to the Miami Herald, this is where
        Neil began his talk radio career.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        In 1973, Rogers moved to Sarasota, where quite by accident he did his
        first talk radio show. The station hired a retiree from Pittsburgh to do
        a talk show, but on his first day, the fellow couldn't figure out to
        work the phone and his guest didn't show up. The second day, the
        retiree's blood pressure soared and his nose bled. Rogers, who was
        spinning records at the station, came to the rescue.
